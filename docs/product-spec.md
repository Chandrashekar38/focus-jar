# Focus Jar â€“ Product Specification

## ðŸ”¥ Vision
A social productivity platform where users build discipline, improve focus, and support each other to become better every day.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Idea
Users build a "Focus Jar" by adding apps they use intentionally. Each app must have a reason. Their jars are public, track usage time, and grow with their discipline. It's gamified, social, and built to make focus fun.
